# 🧶 How Margaret Brought Order to the OpenCloud Spaces

Let’s follow **Margaret**, who works at a mid-sized organization and was given the task of introducing **OpenCloud Spaces** to her team. Her mission? Bring structure, clarity, and good collaboration habits to the team’s digital workspace.

## 🎬 Scene 1: Chaos in Personal Space

After observing her team for a few weeks, Margaret noticed something:

> “Everyone uploads everything to their **Personal Space** — vacation plans, project documents, even holiday party photos — and then shares links via Slack.”

It kind of works… until someone needs to find a file again. Or worse — someone leaves the company, and the shared links stop working.

That’s when Margaret realizes:

> **“We need proper Spaces. And some clear rules.”**

## 💡 Scene 2: Introducing Spaces

In the next team meeting, Margaret explains:

> “Think of **Spaces** like digital team rooms. Every department or project gets its own Space where collaboration happens. Your Personal Space is just for *your* private files.”

She suggests:
- One **Space per project**  
  e.g. `📁 Project Redesign`
- One **Space per department**  
  e.g. `📁 Marketing`, `📁 Finance`
- One **Space for shared resources**  
  e.g. `📁 Templates & Docs`

## 📦 Scene 3: Creating Structure

Margaret creates a Space called `Project Redesign` and walks her colleagues through a clean folder setup:

📁 Project Redesign
├── 📂 Documents
├── 📂 Planning
├── 📂 Meeting Notes
├── 📂 Archive
└── README.md → explains purpose & rules


She sets up **clear permissions**:
- Team members: full access
- Management: read-only
- External partners: access only to `/Documents/Shared`

---

## 🔐 Scene 4: Personal vs. Shared

A coworker asks:
> “Why can’t I just use my Personal Space and share files from there?”

Margaret explains:

> “Your Personal Space is yours only. If you share from there, no one else can manage those files. And if you leave the company, the links break.  
> In a Space, files stay accessible to the team — structured, findable, and secure.”

---

## 🔄 Scene 5: Maintenance and Care

Every few months, Margaret reviews the team’s Spaces:
- Moves old files to the `📂 Archive`
- Deletes empty or unused folders
- Updates access rights for new team members

## 🎯 Margaret’s Final Advice

> “Spaces are our digital workrooms.  
> When we organize them properly, we save time, stress, and mess.  
> So: keep your Personal Space for truly personal stuff — and put everything you want to share in a proper Space with structure and roles.  
> Ready to get started?”
